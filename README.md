# news-reader-react

A news reader app made using ReactJS and Redux.

### Live here: https://news-reader-react.netlify.com/

## Features

- When the app is opened for the first time, the user is asked to choose between
  **one or more** news sources from a list of available news sources
- After that, the user is shown a list of news from the selected sources (sorted by
  publish-time, descending)
- Clicking on the news story will redirect to the relevant news page
- At any point, the user can update their news source selection, thereby updating
  the list of news in the feed
- The user’s choice of news sources should persists across browser sessions. So if you are using the app for the
  second time, you should directly hit the news-list page.
